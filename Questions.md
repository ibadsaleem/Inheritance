Exercises: 
 We want to calculate the total marks of each student of a class in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics and the average marks of the class. The number of students in the class are entered by the user. Create a class named Marks with data members for roll number, name and marks. Create three other classes inheriting the Marks class, namely Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics, which are used to define marks in individual subject of each student. Roll number of each student will be generated automatically.  Make a class named Fruit with a data member to calculate the number of fruits in a basket. Create two other class named Apples and Mangoes to calculate the number of apples and mangoes in the basket. Print the number of fruits of each type and the total number of fruits in the basket.
